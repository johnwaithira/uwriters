Our calling is the unique way in which God has wired us, equipped us, and assigned us to contribute to and advance his kingdom. This is not limited to our spiritual gifts, but it certainly includes them! And even in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul is not exhausting all the spiritual gifts, but using a few as an example to serve his point about how the body of Christ (you, me,&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;we&#60;/em&#62;) works together.&#60;/p&#62;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#13;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#38;ldquo;For those who lead and have a tendency toward pride and self-sufficiency, it may be humbling to know that God wants them to depend on and be built up by others with different gifts. For others, though, this will mean accepting what God has given them and then living and working in the community for the benefit of the body, knowing that this is their God-given and Spirit-enabled duty to the body. Just as there is no place for pride, so there is no place for false humility.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/em&#62;&#38;nbsp;(Paul Gardner,&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;1 Corinthians&#60;/em&#62;, Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, 554.)&#60;/p&#62;&#13;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our spiritual gifts are an essential part of our contribution to the kingdom of God. They are one of the primary ways the gospel works itself in our lives as we serve others. But how can we walk in them if we are not aware of them?&#60;/p&#62;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#60;h3&#62;We need to know our Holy Spirit-given gifts if we want to walk in our full purpose and potential.&#60;/h3&#62;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here are four action steps to take from here.&#60;/p&#62;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#60;ul&#62;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;First&#60;/strong&#62;, take our&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://newbreak.church/spiritual-gifts/&#34;&#62;&#60;strong&#62;spiritual gifts test by clicking HERE&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;. It is not infallible, but it is a good tool to help you consider how God&#38;rsquo;s empowering presence (Holy Spirit) wants to work in and through you.&#60;/li&#62;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Second&#60;/strong&#62;, talk to some other Christians who you respect and who know you well. Ask them what spiritual gifts they see in you. Do not underestimate how someone else can see in you what you might not see in yourself!&#60;/li&#62;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Third&#60;/strong&#62;, study biblical passages on these things. You may have noticed we did not unpack the spiritual gifts in this blog post. It would take quite some time to do so! Plus, let&#38;rsquo;s give you some homework and ownership here. Pick up some commentaries on 1 Corinthians and read how scholars shed light on what Paul is saying about spiritual gifts (especially 1 Corinthians 12-14). The&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.christianbook.com/corinthians-zondervan-exegetical-commentary-new-testament/paul-gardner/9780310243694/pd/243690&#34;&#62;Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on 1 Corinthians&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;is phenomenal, though at times it can be geared toward an academic audience.
